### Hi / Hola ğŸ‘‹

<!-- I'm Vicente, a PhD student at the [National Graphene Institute](https://www.graphene.manchester.ac.uk/ngi/about/). My research is on the characterisation and application of 2D materials (such as graphene) to polymer composites.

I've been interested in programming since leaving high school: While working as a student process engineer at [Syngenta](https://www.syngenta.co.uk/huddersfield), I used LISP to automate line reading for [P&ID CAD](https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/autocad-p-id-and-plant-3d#:~:text=AutoCAD%20P%20ID%20software%20allows,of%20isometric%2C%20and%20orthographic%20drawings.&text=Learn%20more%20about%20AutoCAD%20P%26ID,3D%20in%20the%20product%20center.) drawings, and created data visualisations in R to help with new equipment comissioning. Following that at University, I used MATLAB to model a reactor for my design project. -->
